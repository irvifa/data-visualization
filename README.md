We would like to see the relationship betwen air pollution and health in the Greater London Area (GLA) as it was mentioned inside of
this [report](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/environment/pollution-and-air-quality/health-and-exposure-pollution).

In general there are two pollutants of concern:
- Particulate Matter (PM 2.5)
- Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)

Data was taken from [long temm health impact of air pollution](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/long-term-health-impacts-of-air-pollution).
